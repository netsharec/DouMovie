# DouMovie
A simple android demo for douban movie using mvp architecture.

Recently, I was learning things about the architecure of an android app, like mvp and mvvm. So I decide to make this demo to have a better understanding of **MVP** (Model-View-Presenter). The application is of Material Design, and movie data via Douban API.
